<!-- Homework 06: Pandas and GitHub   -->

<!-- Complete the two notebooks in 06-homework.zipDownload 06-homework.zip

Submit on GradeScope through a GitHub repo. The repo should include:

The two completed notebooks
A README.md that describes the assignment (use markdown syntaxLinks to an external site. to make it look nice)
A .gitignore file, which is a list of files to not add to GitHub
GitHub Desktop should create the README.md and .gitignore for you! And you don't need a .env file, as there are no API keys for this assignment. The only problem is the default .gitignore doesn't include .DS_Store - I like to use https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/Links to an external site. to create .gitignore files before I add the folder to GitHub Desktop. I usually search for macOS, VisualStudioCode, and Python.

You can spend some time reading https://jonathansoma.com/fancy-github/Links to an external site. to learn a little about how GitHub works. It talks about .gitignore files, organizing your repositories, and how to customize your profile.

I also have a video that walks you step-by-step through using GitHub Desktop:
